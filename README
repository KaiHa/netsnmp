The (Haskell) NetSNMP package is a binding for a subset of the libsnmp
api provided by the NetSNMP project.  It is initially being developed
against NetSNMP version 5.4.1, but probably works with most or all 5.*
versions.

Currently supported protocol versions:
  SNMPv1  -- original SNMP
  SNMPv2c -- v2 protocol with old community-based security

Not yet supported:
  SNMPv3  -- v2 protocol plus new v3 party-based security

Other versions are not supported by the underlying library, and are
unlikely to ever be supported by this package.
  SNMPsec -- first attempt to add strong security to SNMPv1
  SNMPv2p -- initial SNMPv2, with v2 party-based security
  SNMPv2u -- v2 protocol with user-based security
  SNMPv2* -- proprietary hybrid variant of v2c and v2p

This binding requires that net-snmp be built without
NETSNMP_DISABLE_SNMPV1 or NETSNMP_DISABLE_SNMPV2C.  I'd love to support
those options, since they may encourage better security, but I won't be able
to prioritize this in the forseeable future.

Version History
===============

0.3.0.6 - OIDpart type is hacked to work correctly on OS X

0.3.0.5 - Tied the OIDPart to the correct C Type of the oid.
          NOTE: This breaks the code on the OS X and we don't know why
                The oid of the SNMP Result can not be read correctly

0.3.0.4 - Reduced the default number of max-repetitions in Bulk PDUs to 30.
          The previous value caused oversized responses on Extreme Network
          switches.

0.3.0.3 - Fixed a bug, where instead of 32 bit, the OID part was set to CLong,
          which became 64 bit in base 4.5

0.3.* - Switch from Strings to ByteStrings

0.2.* - Implementation includes snmpBulkWalk
